# My First Games in Phaser :video_game:
My first game in Phaser.io
- Updated from Phaser CE to Phaser 3

## Using
- Phaser (https://phaser.io/)
- Following ( https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game)

## Issues
- Sounds (Effects and BG)
- Start Screen
- Game Over Screen

## Next Steps

There are lots more things you can do to enhance this. Why not expand the size of the level and allow the camera to scroll? Maybe add in different baddie types, different value pick-ups, or give the player a health bar.

Or for a non-violent style game you could make it a speed-run and simply challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible.
